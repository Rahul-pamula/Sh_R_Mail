# Email Engine — Complete Phase Plan

> This document is the **strategic planning guide** for the Email Engine platform.
> It describes what each phase is, why it exists, what it covers, and the technical architecture behind it.
> Progress tracking (what is done vs. pending) lives in the **interactive HTML tracker** (`docs/progress.html`).

Each phase is divided into TWO parts:
  [BACKEND] — API, database, worker logic
  [FRONTEND] — Pages, components, UX flows

---

## 🏗 CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE: DUAL EMAIL ENGINE
To prevent platform/system emails from going to spam due to DMARC/Spoofing rules, the system uses TWO entirely separate email pipelines:

1. **CENTRALIZED SYSTEM EMAILER (Queue-First via Gmail SMTP)**
   - Uses `shrmail.app@gmail.com` via standard secure SMTP.
   - Purpose: Handles critical platform-to-tenant communications (OTP verifications, sender confirmation, quota warnings, welcome emails, team invites).
   - Why: Guarantees Inbox delivery for critical app functions without needing a verified custom domain.

2. **TENANT CAMPAIGN EMAILER (Self-Hosted MTA / Transact Provider)**
   - Uses the tenant's own verified custom domain (e.g. `sales@theircompany.com`).
   - Purpose: Bulk marketing campaigns, newsletters, subscriber communications.
   - Why: Isolates sender reputation and handles high-volume throughput.
