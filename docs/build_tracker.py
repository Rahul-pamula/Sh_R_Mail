# This dictionary provides plain-English explanations for technical tasks.
DESCRIPTIONS = {
  "shadcn/ui installed and initialized": "The shadcn/ui component library is added to the project — it provides accessible, customizable UI primitives like buttons, dialogs, and inputs.",
  "Inter font installed in root layout": "Google's Inter typeface is loaded globally, giving the entire app a modern, clean, and highly-legible text style.",

  "Typography scale is fully defined": "Font sizes, weights, and line heights form a consistent scale — headings, body text, and captions all feel visually harmonious.",
  "Semantic token set is complete": "Every color token has a meaningful name (e.g. --color-surface, --color-text-muted) so teams talk about intent, not raw HEX codes.",
  "App no longer uses hardcoded colors or inline style-heavy UI": "No component directly writes #1a1a2e or style={{ color: 'red' }} — all colors go through the token system, making theme changes instant.",
  "Design Tokens Documentation Page (internal token reference)": "A living reference page inside the app lists every token name, CSS variable, and its visual output — prevents developers from re-inventing decisions.",
  "Loading skeletons on all list pages (contacts, campaigns, templates)": "While data is being fetched, a pulsing placeholder layout appears instead of a blank screen — improves perceived performance significantly.",
  "Dark / Light mode toggle (CSS variable swap)": "A toggle switches the entire app between dark and light themes by swapping the root CSS variable values — no components need to change.",
  "Button.tsx": "A shared Button component with consistent sizing, colors, loading state, and disabled state — used everywhere so buttons always look the same.",
  "Badge.tsx": "A small inline label component for status indicators like 'Active', 'Paused', 'Draft' — color-coded and reusable.",

  "LoadingSpinner.tsx": "An animated spinner shown during async operations — ensures users always have feedback that work is in progress.",
  "StatCard.tsx": "A card component that displays a single metric (e.g. 'Total Sent: 12,450') with an icon, a number, and a trend indicator.",
  "StatusBadge.tsx": "A badge specifically designed for status values — maps status strings to distinct color themes automatically.",
  "ConfirmModal.tsx": "A confirmation dialog that asks the user to explicitly approve dangerous actions like 'Delete 1,000 contacts' before proceeding.",
  "Toast.tsx": "A small pop-up notification (top-right corner) for showing success, error, or info messages after async operations complete.",
  "PageHeader.tsx": "A consistent header block shown at the top of every page — includes the page title, breadcrumb, and an optional action button.",
  "DataTable.tsx": "A reusable sortable, paginated table component with column definitions — contacts list, campaigns list, and templates all use this.",
  "EmptyState.tsx": "A friendly illustration + message shown when a list has zero items — replaces blank white space with a clear call-to-action.",
  "Breadcrumb.tsx": "A trail of links (e.g. Campaigns › Test Campaign › Analytics) that shows the user where they are inside the app hierarchy.",
  "src/components/ui/index.ts": "A barrel export file — lets you write `import { Button, Badge } from '@/components/ui'` instead of separate import lines per component.",
  "Tailwind config maps tokens to utility names": "The tailwind.config.ts file bridges CSS variables to Tailwind class names so you can write `text-accent` and it resolves to the correct CSS variable.",

  "Every destructive action uses ConfirmModal": "Any button that deletes or permanently modifies data is blocked behind a ConfirmModal — prevents accidental data loss.",
  "Every async form submit uses loading state consistently": "When a form is submitted, its button shows a spinner and disables itself — prevents double-submissions and communicates that work is happening.",
  "Every API success path uses toast feedback consistently": "After a successful API call, a green toast appears — users always know their action was saved.",
  "Every API error path uses toast feedback consistently": "When an API call fails, a red toast appears with a short message — users never see a blank failure silently.",
  "Every empty list uses EmptyState": "All list pages (contacts, campaigns, templates) show the EmptyState component instead of a blank div when there is no data.",
  "Every list page has consistent search and filter behavior": "Search boxes, filter dropdowns, and pagination behave identically across all list pages — users only learn the pattern once.",
  "Mobile navigation is complete end-to-end": "The sidebar collapses into a hamburger menu on small screens, all pages are scrollable, and no UI is clipped or hidden on mobile.",
  "Remove global *:focus { outline: none }": "Removing this rule restores visible keyboard focus indicators — a critical accessibility requirement for users navigating by keyboard.",
  "Modal accessibility is complete (focus trap + restore)": "When a modal opens, keyboard focus is trapped inside it; when it closes, focus returns to the triggering element — standard a11y behavior.",

  "All onboarding endpoints use JWT-only tenant resolution consistently": "No onboarding route reads tenant_id from the request body or query string — it always comes from the verified JWT, preventing spoofing.",
  "Login page": "The frontend login screen with email/password fields, error messaging, and a link to sign up or reset password.",
  "Signup page": "The registration screen where new users create their account — collects name, email, and password, then triggers email verification.",
  "reCAPTCHA on Signup form": "Google reCAPTCHA is added to the signup form to block automated bot registrations.",
  "Onboarding wizard (workspace > use-case > integrations > scale > complete)": "The multi-step setup flow shown to new tenants — it collects workspace name, intended email use case, connected integrations, and expected volume.",
  "Interactive onboarding checklist on dashboard": "The dashboard shows a setup checklist (verify email, add a sender domain, create first campaign) that disappears once all steps are complete.",
  "Sidebar navigation layout": "The left-side navigation bar with links to Contacts, Campaigns, Templates, Analytics, Settings — collapses on mobile.",
  "Auth context exists": "A React context that stores the current user's session (token, role, tenant_id) and provides it to any component via a hook.",
  "Middleware redirects exist": "Next.js route middleware that checks the JWT/session cookie and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page automatically.",
  "Route protection is fully centralized and consistent": "Every protected page uses the same single middleware check — no page accidentally forgets to protect itself.",
  "JWT carries tenant identity": "The JWT payload includes tenant_id so every API call automatically carries workspace context without an extra database lookup.",
  "X-Tenant-ID is validated against JWT when used": "If a request sends an X-Tenant-ID header, the server verifies it matches the tenant_id inside the JWT — prevents tenants from accessing other users' data.",
  "Onboarding tenants are blocked from active-tenant routes": "A guard prevents a tenant still in the onboarding wizard from calling production API endpoints like 'send campaign'.",
  "Social Auth (Google, GitHub) via OAuth 2.0 / Supabase": "Users can sign in with their Google or GitHub account instead of creating a password — handled via Supabase's OAuth integration.",
  "Rate limiting on login + registration endpoints (per IP, per email)": "Login and signup are limited to 10 attempts per minute per IP/email — prevents brute-force password attacks.",
  "Email verification required before onboarding completes": "A user must click the verification link in their email before the onboarding wizard can advance past step 1.",
  "Short-lived access tokens (15-30 min) + silent refresh tokens": "Access tokens expire quickly so stolen tokens have a short window. Refresh tokens automatically issue new access tokens in the background.",
  "Token revocation via token_version counter (force-logout all devices)": "A counter on each user row is incremented to invalidate all existing JWTs instantly — useful for 'sign out everywhere' or account compromise scenarios.",
  "Remove custom /auth/forgot-password endpoint": "The hand-rolled forgot-password route was replaced by Supabase Auth's built-in email flow, which handles token generation and expiry securely.",
  "Remove custom /auth/reset-password endpoint": "Same as above — the custom password-reset handler was removed in favor of Supabase Auth's standard reset flow.",

  "Audit logs table (who did what, when, on which record — metadata only)": "A database table that records every important action (who deleted contacts, who sent a campaign) — stores metadata only, never actual email content.",
  "Audit log table is write-only / immutable (no UPDATE or DELETE allowed)": "Once a log row is written, it can never be changed or deleted — even by admins — making it a tamper-proof activity record.",
  "Log severity levels: INFO / WARNING / CRITICAL on every log row": "Each audit log entry has a severity tag: INFO for normal events, WARNING for unusual ones, CRITICAL for high-risk actions like bulk deletes.",
  "Auto-alert on CRITICAL log events (bulk delete >1000, suspicious login)": "When a CRITICAL event occurs, the system automatically emails the workspace owner — e.g. 'Someone deleted 2,000 contacts from your account'.",
  "Configure Supabase Auth SMTP to use shrmail.app@gmail.com": "Supabase's auth emails (verification, password reset) are routed through your own Gmail account instead of Supabase's generic sender.",
  "Fix forgot-password page — Supabase Auth built-in reset email flow": "The frontend forgot-password page now calls Supabase Auth's built-in reset endpoint instead of a custom one.",

  "Import batch history": "Every CSV upload creates a 'batch' record with stats (total rows, imported, duplicates, errors) so tenants can review past imports.",
  "Deduplication (in-memory + Supabase upsert on tenant_id, email)": "Contacts are deduplicated both in memory (within the file) and at the database level using an upsert — the same email address is never inserted twice per tenant.",
  "Contact status (subscribed, unsubscribed, bounced, complained)": "Each contact has an explicit status that controls whether emails are sent to them. Bounced and complained contacts are automatically excluded from campaigns.",
